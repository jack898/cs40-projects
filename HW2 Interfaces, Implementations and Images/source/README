Implentation Status: 
- UArray2 and Bit2 implementations work as specified 
(and worked functionally when solving Sudoku/unblackedges)
-  Sudoku can check for valid pgm formatting (CRE or not) and valid puzzles
(EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE)
-  unblackedges can check for valid pbm formatting (CRE or not), and if valid
will return plain PBM with black edges removed iteratively per the spec

Time Spent: about 25 hours
