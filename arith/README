ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
---------------------
40image.c: Takes in user arguments to compress/decompress specified ppm file,
or CRE if invalid arguments are provided.

bitpack.c: Performs various bit manipulations, used in compress40 to 
pack and unpack 32-bit codewords.

compress40.c: Compresses or decompresses provided PPM image (depending on
function called from 40image)

a2blocked.c: Provides an abstraction to use UArray2 or UArray2b.

uarray2b.c: Implementation for a blocked UArray interface, used by compress40
to represent rasters of Ppm images.

uarray2.c: Implementation for UArray interface, used by UArray2b.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
---------------------
Thank you to the many TAs who helped us throughout this project.



CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
---------------------
Compressor and decompressor following the COMP40 Image Compression format 
on valid ppm images.

Bitpack interface to perform various bit manipulations on 64-bit signed
or unsigned integers.
